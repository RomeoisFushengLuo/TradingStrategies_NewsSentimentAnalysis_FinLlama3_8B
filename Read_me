Abstract
----
In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of QLoRA-based6
fine-tuning on Meta-LLaMA3-8B for the classification of financial sen-7
timent and signal generation. Leveraging a diverse set of domain-8
specific datasets and the SWIFT framework, our model achieved su-9
perior performance over established baselines—such as FinBERT (a10
classic sentiment analyzer in academia), RoBERTa, and VADER—in11
both sentiment classification and downstream trading strategies on a12
separate financial news dataset.
